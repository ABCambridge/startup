* DOM = Document Object Model
* A file relative to the html file can be referenced using the relative file path. It's relative to the page that contains the link.
* Using the \<div>\</div> tags allows you to give elements their own vertical space, whereas a \<span>\</span> only takes up what space it needs.
* To get a button to follow a link, make the button of type "submit". Then put the button element inside of a form element and make the  form's action="" where you put the relative path to the desired html page in the quotes.
